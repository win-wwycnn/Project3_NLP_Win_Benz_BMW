"Looking to buy a 380/450SL (R107). Things to look out for? I’m currently in the market for one of these beauties to call my weekend beach cruiser (My E30 was fun, but need to give it a rest). Not familiar with this model, nor Mercedes so I have no clue as to what to look out for, or ask.

"Where is this oil coming from? Hey folks, I bought my first Mercedes a couple months back, a 2011 S65 AMG, and recently noticed some dripping oil under the car. I was hoping it was a loose oil drain plug for a quick fix, but upon removing the under carriage cover I saw a bunch of oil dripping down from somewhere higher.


I then removed the intake, and the turbo intercooler sitting on top of the valve cover to get a better look, and snapped some photos for y'all.  It definitely looks like it's coming from the top somewhere.


Any pointers or advice? I haven't cleaned anything in order to try to get a  feel for where it's coming from.


Is it coming from the oil filler cap? or the valve cover gasket?

Edit1: (added link to imgur instead of embedding images)


Edit2: Forgot to add that I got the  ""Check engine oil level (add 1 quart)"" indicator at 108,552, I added 1 quart of oil, then came on again at 109,133. It seems as if I lost a quart of oil over 581 miles.

"BMW Alarm Hello, I just recently purchased my first BMW for a really good deal. I feel really happy with the purchase overall, but the only thing that I feel a little weird about is the lack of an alarm. It's also strange that I don't hear a beep or any sound when I lock my doors and I am always scared I didn't lock my car.


I was trying to look into having BMW install an alarm for me. I don't really want an aftermarket alarm because I like the simplicity of having the alarm attached to my key. A google search didn't reveal much for me in terms of a 2015 car and the BMW website sells alarms for older cars. Can anyone give me some perspective on this?

"I miss my CL600. Thinking about getting another W215 or W220. In '07 I bought an '03 CL600 with 26k miles on it. As soon as the warranty expired I did some work on it and brought the power up to 536/779 at the tires. I had been an American muscle guy for a long time - so it really look me by surprise how much power the car had, but also how comfortable and quiet the car was. That was also part of the problem. It was almost boring to drive. Even though it was a sub-11 sec 1/4 mile car that did 173 at the Texas Mile; most of the time it just felt like such a ""disconnected"" drive.


I kept the car until '12 when I started to have some electrical/airbag gremlins, but up until then it was a fantastically reliable car (minus the common M275 issues like coil packs and intercooler pump along with the PSE pump). The issues was the passenger presence sensor, but it made me realize the car was getting 'older' and wouldn't be as easy to keep up as the years went on as my older American cars (yeah, they're made cheap but parts are everywhere and easily user installed). So...I reluctantly at 58k miles sold my beloved CL600 and the MB Star laptop I had for it.


Anyway, now that I'm getting older, I realize a 'boring drive' wouldn't be so bad. I'm thinking about looking for an '03+ W215 or W220 (since the W215 back seat is useless anyway) with either the M275 or M113K. I remember mine had plastic that got very brittle with age, but other than ABC issues and the previously mentioned trouble, what else can I expect beyond what a 'normal' car would have issues with? I know the M275 itself is borderline indestructible and the 722 trans is solid. I'm not nearly as familiar with the M113K powertrain. Never really got into the looks of the W216/W221, so I'd rather stick with the older looks.

"Advice for a Mercedes-Benz C240 2003 Hey everyone, I bought C240 03 (non-Kompressor) last September and have loved the thing to death. I've been keeping up with all the maintenance and any needed repairs were addressed.

"Air Ride on my 1972 Mercedes 280SEL (X-Post from /r/Cars) /r/cars thought y'all might like to see this as well, and I agree! 


This is my 1972 Merc 280SEL (W108). It's been stock its entire life, and while they have great lines stock, I thought some whitewalls (girlfriend's favorite part) and air ride might class it up even more. We installed a system that uses wifi and an iphone app to control the level/height. That way, no modifications were made to the cabin of the car. And the bags were installed in such a fashion that the car could be put back to stock and no one would ever know.


Here is a picture! I'd love to know what y'all think, and I'm happy to answer any questions for anyone who might want to do a similar project.

It now has an original Texas 1972 plate on it, so don't bother trying to track it down. And it has the Mercedes of Beverley Hills plate cover that I found in the trunk on it as well! The original window sticker (which I have) shows that's where it was purchased.

"If your thinking of leasing a Mercedes, my advice is to stay away!!! If you're thinking of leasing a Mercedes, stay away...  This is actually the first reddit post I have done, and I am not into bashing other companies, or writing negative reviews.


But I felt compelled to warn other people if they are on the fence of leasing a Mercedes.  My lease return was up in December.  When I did the vehicle inspection, Mercedes hit me with a $1,700.00 bill.  I was allowed 36k miles, I actually returned the car with 24k miles on it.  Barely driven it.  They basically told me if I get into another Benz, they would waive the balance.  I didn't want to because I didn't know what my job situation was going to be in 3-6 months.  So I decided to not lease until that the job thing was more clear.  Mercedes knowing that I will not be leasing right away decided to tack on so many fees.  I called them up and asked if there is anything they can do, but there customer service was lousy and they were not willing to budget (unless I decided to lease another car from them).  No way I will ever lease a Mercedes if they were the last car company on earth.  Posting this to serve as a heads up to potential people thinking about it.  I've leased my cars in the past, and the Mercedes thing left a pretty awful taste in my mouth.  There thing is, unless we can sell you another car, we are going to try to make as much $$$ on you when you exit.  


I suppose if you want to finance, that is a different story.  But there lease experience is horrible, and would advice anybody thinking of leasing a Mercedes to look elsewhere.",0,1
"Mercedes-Benz dealer never changed oil on r171 prestige plus for 80.000KM! potential engine damage.. hello good day!


today i discovered that my mother's Mercedes R171 prestige plus has never had a full oil change in the 5years/80k+ km she has owned the vehicle.


i went over all the repair bills due to a suspicion of bad service.


and it turns out. the vehicle while in procession of my mother. being serviced more than once a year at Mercedes-Benz The Hague.


NEVER had a full oil change/flush as per required in the service manual.


as of the last 4 months. the vehicle has been using about half L of oil per full tank of gas. but no smoke. or leaking oil. inside of the exhaust is also not coated in black.


the vehicle is also throwing oil pressure warnings when driving in a sporty manner. and you can hear the valves clicking away. especially when at operating temperatures. 


Mercedes-Benz The Hague has looked at it. and ""claimed"" to have replaced a oil sensor.  i took a look today. and the fucker looks untouched. no way that's been replaced within the last 50k's


this is when i started to dig into the service bills and prior service work. finding the lack of important service work that should've been done with the A and B services.


the vehicle is currently at 159.xxx KM. and she purchased the vehicle when it was in the range of about 84.xxx KM.


i suspect due to lack of oil changes. filters/channels might have clogged up causing engine oil pressure issues and perhaps even oil starvation issues near the valves...


i went to a buddies garage real quick to give him a peek of the car so i have some extra eye's to judge the situation.


and even he agrees that it's suspicious about the state of the ""replaced"" oil sensor. 


along with comments on how loud the valve's appear to be even after confirming that the oil is still well within the operating levels. (I've topped up the oil with a quart about a week ago)


what do we do now?  obviously we wil be giving it the proper oil flush and cleaning. but i suspect the damage is likely already done.


where do we go with this issue? would mercedes-benz be responsible for any of the engine's damages that's been done?


 i feel like the Benzh location is at least partly responsible for the severe neglect to the vehicle's engine?..


I'd say it's to be expected. and especially when talking about official mercedes facilities..  that service to the car and it's engine is done by the book and it's rules.

"Am I getting scammed by Mercedes? I’ll try to keep this as short as possible. On 1/18/23, I signed a contract to buy a GLS 450 with zero down and a 6.5 percent interest rate (not good, and I have good credit, but I also recognize it’s not the best time to get a loan). A few days pass, and the finance manager calls me and says I have additional paperwork to complete. Strange, but okay. 


Today I went in and they told me my interest rate would have to be 10.5 percent. Apparently, the 6.5 percent that I signed for on 1/18 wasn’t finalized? They said they’d drop the price of the car to compensate, but my payments still ended up being higher by more than $100/month. I told them only the original agreed upon terms were okay. They then went into some nonsense about “I should meet them in the middle”, and I just said, that, while I understood they were in a predicament, I was ultimately not responsible for solving a problem they’re responsible for. There is no need for me to meet in the middle.


I had to leave to drop off my friend at the airport, not having signed any additional paperwork, and the finance manager calls me about twenty minutes later and suggests he found the perfect deal. Basically, offering to throw in an extended warranty for up to 85,000 miles, while dropping my monthly payment. The new interest rate would be 6.25 percent — .25 percent less than my original rate. 


I asked for more information, and they just said we don’t like to talk finances over the phone, so please come I. tomorrow. Keep in mind, I have the car in my possession.

What does a slipping transmission mean in these E36s? I know some transmissions can recover with a fluid change+filter. Is that something that could work here, or just replace it?


What has to be done besides that, given the motor is good? I hear about cooling systems.. Is that like a replace whole system before symptoms kind of thing?

Any suggestions would help I checked all the fuses and electrical seems out of the question.

I was close to getting the Johnson's insulatir film installed for $360 and cancelled the appointment when I found that a forum poster confirmed with Johnson's that the film is not compatible with BMW comfort access. 


Other offerings in my area are 3M crystalline, color stable, Solargard ultra performance, and Solargard  high performance. I'm looking to stay in the $300 price range so 3M cystalline is a bit too much at around $600. 3M color stable is in similar ~$300 price range as is Solargard ultra performance. Solargard high performance supreme is affordable as well. As far as I know, the Solargard ultra performance is the only nano-ceramic film aside from the Johnson's insulatir.

I recently drove my 2005 C230 several 100 miles and after the trip my car now shakes and the engine labors at startup in the morning. After 20-30 seconds the laboring and shaking goes away and the car functions  well. Is this a cause for concern? What could it be? With cost of parts relative to total value of the car I’m hesitant to get any major changes done to the car.

"Bluetooth Audio Help I have a 2014 X3 xDrive28i SUV with the premium sound system. It has always mind boggled me that a newer vehicle, especially a BMW, has Bluetooth technology for connecting phone audio but not multimedia for music. Even my mom's Ford Escape has this feature. Anyway, since that's just the way it is, I wondered how other owners addressed this. Although not the most convenient, I didn't usually mind to use my auxillary cord which has equally good sound quality as when playing things on the radio/XM/USB port. My newest phone however, Google Pixel 2 XL, doesn't have an auxiliary port - (That's a whole other irritating issue but it seems like phone manufactures are moving in that direction, so I digress.) My only option for music from my phone is to use Bluetooth.


All that being said, I have tried a handful of different Bluetooth audio transmitters. Some sounded terrible with a lot of static, sounding ""under water"", non-existent bass/treble, etc. The most recent I got remains connected in the center console to both power outlet & the auxiliary port (BlueStream). It cost around $40 at Best Buy. It sounds ok but still sounds incredibly low quality compared to the radio or running directly from phone to auxiliary. No static type sound but very low bass/treble. quality, volume has to be turned up significantly, etc. I've played a lot with the equalizer options but no luck there either. 


I plan on keeping this car for quite a while so I want a better solution if one exists. The car is still under warranty plus I don't like consideration of any aftermarket sterio replacement options. Has anyone had better luck with another option? I'm not so concerned with price if the sound quality is good. I tried to include as much info as possible.

"E87 Bluetooth/Music options? Hey all


Have just spent the last thirty minutes searching, if the question has been answered somewhere else please link.


I have a 2010 118d E87 and am trying to get bluetooth connectivity for audio - not just phone calls. To do this in the past with other vehicles I have managed to find a module on the internet that plugs into one of the inputs in the rear and a 12V feed. The stereo then just thinks it's a CD stacker or something, and when the car starts up it automatically connects to my phone for music, and fields phone calls as well with an integrated mic that you mount somewhere in the cabin.


Does anyone know of such a product for my car? I do have 3.5mm AUX input under the centre console, and some strange plug inside the centre console itself - I'm guessing this is for a phone of some sort. The stereo currently connects just fine via bluetooth to my phone for phonecalls only.

So anybody have good suggestions of a nice balance between comfort/performance/price, or am I stuck with being cheap and driving on deathtraps? (They're getting replaced either way, but it'd be nice to upgrade to something better when the time comes around)",0,1
"Should oil change light be manually updated? Hello,


Yesterday I got an oil change on my 428. I did the in-car system update for the oil which stated that my oil is at 100%.
But still, when I go to my vehicle status, it says that I need an oil change and that I should schedule an appointment with a service center ASAP.


I got my oil changed at a local auto shop.


So my question is: do I need to manually update the oil change service status? I am concerned that the car should have automatically done it for me. Maybe the oil change was bad? I did not use a familiar mechanic that I trust 100%.


Thank you",1,0
"Inherited 1991 300E. Worth it? My recently deceased father's car is a 1991 300E 2.6L, which was well taken car off until about two years ago.  Garaged, California weather.  


I had the car taken to dad's mechanic, had him give me an estimate to fix anything that needs fixing.  He came up with a list which included routine maintenance issues (oil change, filter changes, topping off fluids), transmission gasket replacement, power steering return line replacement, cooling hose replacement, rear flex disc replacement, and a few minor things, all totaling just under 2000 USD.  


From several sources the car is worth more than that, but I am curious what Mercedes fans think of this car.  Does it make sense to fix it up, or would it be better to scrap it?

"I just repaired the PSE (vacuum pump that controls door locks, soft close, etc.) on my '03 SL500 and it was super cheap and easy. It all started with the top not opening one day so I searched for info and discovered that it may be related to the PSE pump so I tried locking the doors and inflating the Lumbar support and nothing worked.


I then checked the fuse and it was blown so I replaced the 20 amp fuse for the pump and the top would go down but it kept blowing within a few minutes. 


I researched further and learned that the pump is responsible for opening the trunk when the handle is pulled and with the pump inoperative the sensor was not receiving a signal that the trunk was closed and therefore the top would not go down.  


I realize that not everyone has a convertible but it does not matter, if you lose functions as described above, especially the door locking, then this may be the fix for you.


Through my searching I found one of the most informative YouTube sites I have ever found; I Fix My Benz.  After watching his videos I ordered the new PSE rotor from his link and just installed it in a couple of hours and appears to be working.  


The other option is to purchase a new pump assembly which is over 10 times the cost of the rotor and then you have to pay the dealer to match it to your car I believe.  


Anyway, I can go on but if you have any questions please let me know and here is the video on how to remove the pump in the SL500 (R230) but he has videos for other models and after removing he has videos on how to replace the rotor.

First, let me apologize for my chaotic writing and lack of good speech skills. I hope you understand the better part of what Im typing haha.


Well.. Back again for some sound advice, as Im running out of them already.


2 months ago I went to mechanics shop with gearbox problems on my fathers E280. It was hesitating while being cold,  couldnt decide which gear to slap in between 1st-2nd and the 2nd-3rd. This would go on for a while until it gets warm enough and some kind of semi-active clutch engages (so ive heard).


Now, supposedly,  they checked everything, changed oil (the-mercedes-recommended-oil-type-and-brand) and said that this gearbox runs great now... Which was semi-true.
It started to change gears faster, and instead of hesitating  - ""angrily""  dropping into gear (imagine dumping clutch in manual a little too fast while changing gears type of movement).
Today, my father came back from a small roadtrip and says the gearbox, even warm, started to hesitate and hold gears for too long.


I think it may be time to prepare for a new gearbox.

I had the B5 service and they ended up putting in new spark plugs as it was at the 60k mark on the odometer and due to be changed. Prior to the service, my car was actually running pretty damn good, there was nothing that stood out to me as needing attention. Got it serviced and now I feel like its actually running worse! I feel like it has no power (and please don't make any jokes about the fact that its an A180 Automatic 🙄) and is having issues with changing gears.


It doesn't seem to have the power to accelerate well and its almost like its having issues changing gears. From a standstill, it feels like its revving high and just not able to get out of the lower gears easily. And there's a few times where I'm going up a small hill and I'm unable to maintain the speed, I've got my foot hard on the pedal and the car just gets slower and slower going up the hill and just cant accelerate.

"9G-Tronic weird shifting (not shifting) So I picked up my second hand SLC 300 with an automatic transmission on couple days ago. I have been discovering it in the past few days, and today something weird happened. The car did not shift down from third gear as I started slowing down, and the car started jerking and stalling.


Preludes that lead up to this:
I was in Sport+ mode.
Very bumpy road section.
Slowing down with engine brake as I was approaching the red light.
Gave a tiny trickle of throttle for a second. (don't know why)
It was then that the automatic transmission continued on in third gear and did not shift down, as I lost speed. 


Theory 1: the bumpy road shifted something around in the transmission, since the SLC is a very stiff ride.
Theory 2: the tiny half a second throttle may have tricked the computer into thinking that I want to accelerate, thus it making it not shift down. If theory 2 is the case, then it still shouldn't happen. The second the engine starts to stall, the computer should recognize it and shift down immediately.


Anyone encounter the same problem? Should I worry about it, or does it just seem like a ""one in a million"" scenario?

"Driving 1987 300sdl without Turbo for a couple months? So, I am about to become a proud owner of my first Mercedes. It's a 1987 300sdl. The only problem with it is that the turbo isn't working. I work with mechanics at my job, so they checked it out and said they'd just have to ""clean the turbo out"" and give it sort of a tune up (some new little components costing next to nothing), and it'll work fine. The job will be 4-5 mechanic hours, so that's where I can't afford the work just yet.

 Another thing i noticed that only in the poor neighborhoods you will see a lot of fancy, shiny MBs parked, looks like mostly people who cannot afford them actually buy them.

"How hard is it to replace the transmission fluid on a W202? Other questions inside Hey everyone,


Just had the fortune of getting handed down a 1998 C230, and I love this car but I've a few questions about it:




In first gear, primarily at low speeds, the shift into second is quite jerky. I imagine this is due to the transmission being low (correct me if I'm wrong though). How difficult is it to replace it?


The car fogs up like crazy when it's cold. Is there a part that can be replaced to help remedy this?


The lighting on the climate control is out. Is everything in the panel controlled by that one single lightbulb? I already have the keys to take it out as we put a custom head unit in.


Lastly, as someone who doesn't have a 
ton
 of money, $800 for the maaco paint job or $1200 for the family-owned restoration? The clear coat has stripped on the hood and the roof of the car :(




Other than those things, I absolutely love this car. Fun to drive and the shape of it is fantastic. Wish they made the newer ones like this.

"116d Advantage infotainment Hi y'all!
Sorry for coming here with n00b questions but I'm really struggling with something. So I finally manage to get a company car and, among other manufacturers, there's a BMW 116d Advantage (no other extras) I can pick from. As far as I know this car was built in 2018 but I get little to no information about what infotainment includes. I've been browsing and searching and came to no conclusion what version of iDrive ships with (5 or 6), whether Apple CarPlay can be enabled or not, what actual ConnectedDrive services can be used and so on. Basically it just says that I can use my (i)phone with it.
I cannot contact the dealer as this was not disclosed by the company; contacting a different dealer might be an option but I didnt want to give them the task of explaining me things when others will sell...
Do you guys know if there's a summary of that? Like a total list of what features comes in?
I live in Portugal btw, if that matters for some specific services being available.


Thanks and drive safe!",1,0
"Dealer lied to me (Signed lease). What are my options? Hey guys!


I recently signed an agreement to lease a 2016 BMW 428xi GC in Montreal (Canada) and the dealer told me that I would have it within a week. The agreement I signed is just one sheet of paper and I placed a deposit of 1k. I did not receive the VIN number at that time since they said they will need to order the car from another dealership. About 4 days later I get a call from them saying that the car they wanted to reserve for me was sold. The reason I signed for the lease was because they had told me that I would get the car the following week. Then they went on to tell me that they placed an order for a brand new car for me and that would take about 2 months to get it. Being frustrated I came to an agreement where they would give me the same car with black metallic instead of the original jet black that I wanted at no extra charge (The car was supposed to take 3-4 weeks to deliver since it was already on a boat).


Fast forward 2 weeks, I receive a call stating that my car just finished production and that it now is a matter of logistics and that it would take 5-6 weeks to get my hands on the car. (WTF). I feel like i've been fooled by the dealership and I am thinking about cancelling the lease altogether. Seeing how winter is fast approaching and I will not really enjoy the car during winter due to the amount of snow we get in Montreal. This pisses me off.


I really don't mind waiting a month but at this point the trust has been broken and I am fed up. If I don't cancel the lease (which I think I won't be able to), is there a way to get them to include free winter tires or perhaps give them to me at cost?


The contract I signed is just one sheet of paper with the monthly payments, my trade in value, and at the bottom it does state that this is not a ""promise"". It does say it is an offer to lease.


What should I do? I really do not want to cancel but if I can get something out of it (tires) then I would still be happy.",1,0

I have a 2012 323i. Just now my 1.5 year old managed to lock himself inside and we've just had to call Road Services to get him out. He's not having much luck.

"very disappointed Let me tell you how I wasted 2 weeks. I was super close to getting a very nice and clean Certified 2014 435i. It was the perfect F32 I could ask for, has every M extra you can want, harman kardon sound, and many more packages, even the surround cameras. It was the perfect color too, mineral grey with coral red interior, and only 20K miles. It also had style 441m rims.


So I went to go check out the car (it was at the service center at the time) (friday may 19) , the sales person said that it needs to get certified and one of the wheels are bent due to a pothole, understandable. So I left that day and I had the car tagged (i saw the sales person fill out the yellow paper) and was re-assured the car is mine and wasn't gonna be sold. (These 2 BMW dealers work together and share inventory, here's why this matters)..


Yesterday I ask the sales person any update with the car (he said it should be ready for me to actually get by the beginning of this week), and he said he has horrible news, and that someone from the other dealer somehow sold the car.. I end up calling the other dealer, and the other dealer's salesperson said that he didn't see any tag on the car in the computer, which means my sales person only put a tag on the car on paper, and never fully tagged it through the computer. 


I'm so mad at the fact I just lost such a clean car, and the fact that I saw the car first and was ready to buy it too. Also, I called my sales person every day last week to see any update on the car, and he's telling me it's still being certified/serviced, yet the car was sold last wednesday, and was out of the service center beginning of last week! The rest of the 435i's being sold at those dealers are just non-M sport package and missing packages. So I'm probably going to have to wait a super long time until another one comes.

"Looking to purchase a 2007 C280. Looking for tips/advice Looking at picking up a 2007 C280 as a ""second"" vehicle for winters and utilitarian reasons since it has 4 doors. It has just about 90k miles and ran and drove very nicely during my 10~ minute test drive. Whisper quiet, no vibration, smooth ride. Quite nice. Trans shifted smoothly, but on the slow side, but it's an automatic from the mid 2000's so I think that's a pass (let me know if I'm wrong here).


I'm trying to do my own research online and what I've found is that it's probably due for a timing chain soon, and that these M272 engines are prone to balance shaft issues. However, some are saying that the cars with this issue typically show before 75k~ miles or so, and this is beyond that. These are from posts from 2011-2013ish on popular MB forums though, so this information may or may not be still valid. I see balance shaft issues are a $4k+ ticket, but I can't find anything on timing chain replacement cost. I'm fairly handy (and my father is an absolute wizard) so we may be able to handle a timing chain on our own, but I'd rather not bother him with it if I can.


Oh, and the battery light came on about halfway through the test drive. It didn't die on me, so my google-fu says it might be a voltage regulator. I'll bring a voltmeter with me when I go to test drive it again.


Any tips/pointers? Run away? Looking to keep my initial purchase expense to under $7k, but obviously lower is better. I can probably buy the car for $4k-$4.5k. Leaves some wiggle room for initial repairs (or wear items).

I was reading online and apparently you can get key fobs (programmable) that let you create a key less remote (which is apparently very cheap and easy to do), I don't know what specific fob I need to buy to do this.

Lock your car.
Get into the car. Close driver&#039;s door.
Connect and disconnect the ignition.
Remove the ignition key.
Press unlockbutton and hold.
Within 10 seconds press and release three times short of the lock button, while unlockbutton is pressed.
Release unlockbutton.
Some models, LED flashes slowly for 10 seconds.
Some models, central locking system locks and unlocks in rapid sequence to indicate correct programming.
Some models: Repeat the above if the central locking does not work and the LED does not blink or keeps flashing.

NOTE: A maximum of 4 programmable keys. Perform programming of each key within 30 seconds.



My other option is to somehow call BMW and order a second and maybe third set of keys. I am living in Australia so I don't know how difficult acquiring a legitimate cut key would be.

I figured it was because it started getting cold and I haven't been able to plug the block heater in. It would crank really slow and then eventually turn over. And then it got to where it would crank really slow and then just slow down and die. So I started carrying a jump box with me, and about once every three times I started it, I would have to jump it. Now, I don't think this is a battery issue; I replaced my battery last year. Glow plugs have all been replaced in the past three years and fuel pumps too. Well, this morning I turn the key and nothing. No slow crank, no hum, not even the clicking sound it would make when the battery died. And obviously jumping it did no good.

Vibration at about 70mph. Kind of high frequency to be an off balance tire. It's enogh to be heard in certain circumstances. I'm having the dealer investigate further as this is the biggest question mark for me at the moment.


Both headlights top mounting tab is cracked (is this common?).


Oil seepage from timing covers (minor).


RF lower ball joint moderate play. 


Oil seepage at front differential pinion flange (minor).


Brake fluid leaking from loose RF caliper bleeder (!!! NOT happy about this one).




The tech said overall it looked pretty nice. He said the seepage at the timing covers and pinion cover were minor and not real cause for concern. Balljoing play is self explanitory.

So there it is, I've worked all summer long and I decided to go get myself a Mercedes ! I found a great Mercedes C320 2001 (W203) and I jumped on it. 3 weeks later, my car is in the mechanics shop for a transmission fluid leak. I've read a lot on Mercedes transmissions and I'm still not sure wheter this is a transmission fluid problem or a TCM problem. Here is a list of all the problems I had since I bought it:


- I was driving approx. 95mph and suddenly, the car stopped giving power, my wheels stopped moving for a fraction of a second and the car went in neutral. Got on the side of the road, turned off the car and powered it up, everything went back to normal.- Same thing happend maybe one week after.- I was at a red light, when it turned green the car didn't had any power, like if it was stuck in 3rd or 4th gear. Gave it a lot of power (because there was upcoming trafic on the other side), the car ''bounced'' a lot and got back to normal.


- When I start to move the car around in first gear, sometimes I hear some rumbling noise, I suspect it's only metal ratteling but, still.- In the morning, I've found that there was a big oil leak right below my car. I went straight to the mechanic and identified it as a transmission fluid leak.


Now, it's getting repaired as I'm writing this post but a thousand dollars later in repairs, I still hope the TCM is not done as well. What do you guys think ? Feel free to ask as many questions as you want.
