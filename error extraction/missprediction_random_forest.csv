Where do you buy your OEM and aftermarket BMW parts There seems to be a few decent online retailers for aftermarket parts  but any time I need OEM parts I usually buy them from the dealer. What are the reputable shops you have bought from and also anyone know a decent S/C other than Dinan for an M54 engine.,1,0

"E63S maintenance cost So I currently have a m4 comp and have been thinking about switching to a E63S after winter and wanted to ask what I’m supposed to expect for maintenance costs, is it gonna be about the same as for the m4 or Is it drastically more ?

"European Delivery So I’ve been eyeballing a 2018/2019 M4 Convertible for some time now. I’ve finally made some moves by going in and test driving them and I’m starting to look more into actually ordering one. Im looking at ordering one for a couple reasons. A) You can’t hardly find a true manual 6 speed M4 Convertible. Yeah, I get it. The DCT is much faster and smooth and yada yada yada. I like the tactile feel of a 6 speed. B) I’ve decided on getting Verde Mantis Individual Paint with full Silverstone interior. Not a combo that sits on a dealer lot. 


Since I’m going to have to special order the car, the thought has come to mind about doing the European Delivery but I have a couple questions for those that have gone through the process. 


How did the DMV handle the car when you brought it back to the states and registered the car?  I’m guessing you pay the US/state/county taxes when you order it from your local BMW dealer?  I’ve purchase a used car out of state before and got hit with taxes when I tried to register it in Illinois before. Not sure how the state might handle it. 


I understand you save around 5-6% off MSRP by doin European delivery. Was your dealer open to further negotiations on the purchase price?  I’ve been doing research and it seems hit or miss. 


If I order it soon, it will be a winter delivery. European countries require winter tires by law. You can rent winter tires for your trip. How was that process?  


Thanks for any input that you all might have.",1,0

"The story about my 1997 BMW Z3 Hey guys this will be a long post as I want to give the short history about my Z3 and at the end if anyone wants to give some helpful advice, that’s fine.


I got my 1997 BMW Z3 when I was 18. It was a single-owner car so it pretty good condition when I bought it. And of course, I didn’t treat the car the way that I should have. Eventually things on it started giving out. And at one point, I took the car to a local mechanic to have some front end repairs done. The ball joins mainly, on the passenger side.


A few days later while at work the mechanic calls me, and asks ‘is there a trick to getting your car to crank?’ I said no, it was cranking just fine when I brought it to you. He asked me to come to the shop and look at it.


I was furious. The shop had already done the repairs to the front end, but sure enough, the car would not crank. The lights would come on, headlights, dash lights, etc. but when turning the key, no click, no spinning, no nothing.


Decided it wasn’t worth going to court over, so I loaded up the car and left.


I took the car to another mechanic. This one works on Z3’s regularly, and left it in his shop for 3 weeks before calling me back, ‘I’m not going to be able to work on it. You need to come get it cause it’s taking up space’


I then called my school teacher who is one of the most skilled mechanics I’ve known, and asked his advice. He felt extremely confident he could figure it out. So I took it to his classroom and dropped it off(mind you, the teacher would be working on it, not the students). After 1 year of waiting (every time I called he told me it was going to take some time), he ended up losing his job. So the principal called me told me I needed to come get it.


So at this point, I called the BMW dealership. They said they don’t work on older models, because their employees are only trained on the new stuff.


I parked the BMW in my backyard and let it sit for a year. Thought about scrapping it for cash, or selling it for used parts.


The part I hate so much about this situation, is I’m 100% sure it’s a simple fix, if somebody knew what was wrong with it. It’s either related to the theft system, or the first mechanic pinched a wire somewhere. Both of those things are beyond my knowledge.


I have two other vehicles at this time, a 2000 Dodge Ram and a 2018 Honda Civic. So I’m not depending on my BMW getting fixed. But I have dreams every few weeks about driving the car again. And that keeps me wanting to fix it..


So, I found a mechanic 3 hours out of town, who specializes in BMW and used to work for the BMW dealership a long time go. He felt completely confident he could tackle this. So once again, I borrowed my dads trailer, hooked it up to my dodge, pushed the BMW up onto it, and once again, hauled it to a mechanic.


This guy has been a little different. He told me(of course) he found a rats nest from when it was sitting in my backyard, told me I needed to buy a battery, starter and alternator. And said $550 for those three things and the labor so far. I said go ahead and call me back when you know something else.(I haven’t paid anything yet, it’s just what I will owe when the work is done)


Well he’s had the car a total of 8 months now, and when I call they tell me ‘we’re working on it little by little so we don’t have to charge you labor until we figure out what exactly is the problem’. But I’m under the impression at this point he has given up. I called a few weeks ago and asked how it went putting the parts on and they said they haven’t put any parts on, and didn’t know what I was talking about. Then reminded me it’s going to be awhile, unless I want to get charged massive labor.


So I’m in limbo at this point. I might just pick the car back up and start swapping parts myself until I find out what it is.

"BMW Alarm Hello, I just recently purchased my first BMW for a really good deal. I feel really happy with the purchase overall, but the only thing that I feel a little weird about is the lack of an alarm. It's also strange that I don't hear a beep or any sound when I lock my doors and I am always scared I didn't lock my car.


I was trying to look into having BMW install an alarm for me. I don't really want an aftermarket alarm because I like the simplicity of having the alarm attached to my key. A google search didn't reveal much for me in terms of a 2015 car and the BMW website sells alarms for older cars. Can anyone give me some perspective on this?

"I miss my CL600. Thinking about getting another W215 or W220. In '07 I bought an '03 CL600 with 26k miles on it. As soon as the warranty expired I did some work on it and brought the power up to 536/779 at the tires. I had been an American muscle guy for a long time - so it really look me by surprise how much power the car had, but also how comfortable and quiet the car was. That was also part of the problem. It was almost boring to drive. Even though it was a sub-11 sec 1/4 mile car that did 173 at the Texas Mile; most of the time it just felt like such a ""disconnected"" drive.


I kept the car until '12 when I started to have some electrical/airbag gremlins, but up until then it was a fantastically reliable car (minus the common M275 issues like coil packs and intercooler pump along with the PSE pump). The issues was the passenger presence sensor, but it made me realize the car was getting 'older' and wouldn't be as easy to keep up as the years went on as my older American cars (yeah, they're made cheap but parts are everywhere and easily user installed). So...I reluctantly at 58k miles sold my beloved CL600 and the MB Star laptop I had for it.


Anyway, now that I'm getting older, I realize a 'boring drive' wouldn't be so bad. I'm thinking about looking for an '03+ W215 or W220 (since the W215 back seat is useless anyway) with either the M275 or M113K. I remember mine had plastic that got very brittle with age, but other than ABC issues and the previously mentioned trouble, what else can I expect beyond what a 'normal' car would have issues with? I know the M275 itself is borderline indestructible and the 722 trans is solid. I'm not nearly as familiar with the M113K powertrain. Never really got into the looks of the W216/W221, so I'd rather stick with the older looks.

"86' E325es as first car? Before I start, I apologize if this topic is overdone but I just wanted some advice from people who know what they're talking about. 


Also, allow me to explain my situation. I'm 18 and the car in question is listed for 2000, maybe even less if I can talk the buyer down. I have the money to buy it up front, and will have extra money for repairs (2 grand a check, not including OT). I have literally zero mechanical experience, but I'm more than willing, and actually want to learn, seeing as this is my dream car (model and all). I mention that because I am aware of the reputation BMW has regarding repairs. My goal is getting this car to become something I drive daily, and I accept that it could take some work to get it there. Speaking of that, are repairs too terribly hard that even a beginner, who is actually excited to learn, would not be able to keep up? 


Now, the car. 86' 325es with 129k miles (they say thats where the odometer stopped) and that it runs and drives but is a project car. They recently changed timing belt, OEM boot, and comes with RacingPros chip (if that means anything). I havent gone to check it out in person, as I was wanting an opinion here before.


Basically, is it worth it? I fully realize it is a 30 year old car so it will obviously have problems, but since this car's been a dream of mine for quite some time, I'm willing to learn how to repair it myself, as well as be able to pay for it myself. Am I going to regret the purchase regardless because of frequent need for repairs, or maybe my inexperience in working on cars?


If this isn't the way for me to go, what general models/makes should I look for when going for a good budget car that will last so long as I take care of it (which I will).

Sorry if there is a more appropriate sub. 


Not a complaint post but more just seeing if anyone has some input that would add some value to the situation. I know things can go wrong with mechanical / electrical components ;) 


Was driving the car a few days ago, and about 3-4 seconds after starting up, putting in drive and moving about 10m the car stalled (automatic). Interesting, started her back up and drove off, no problem for another few days. 


Started the car up in the morning, engine light on and error ""collision prevention assist plus inoperable"". Turned off, turned back on no problem. Other than engine light coming back on (later disappeared). 


Took car in to dealership that afternoon anyway just to play it safe and see if they can run it through computer to see if any issues / updates etc. 


Other issue to note, is when opening or closing the sunroof there is a bit of a pop/bang (not that loud) during the transition of opening/closing. To me, seems like a balance issue as the weight of the roof shifts from some kind of pivot position. 


Anyway, diagnosis:




Sunroof needs the ""guide mechanism ""replaced. $5k AUD / $3.4k USD.


Car battery ""midtronics test fail"". $580 AUD / $400 USD for new battery. 


The main issue noted was carbon build up on the intake system, they have quoted $500 AUD for a machine flush BUT also state this might not to do the job and a full dismantle of the intake manifold and EGR system would need hand cleaning. This is estimated at $2k AUD / $1374 USD.




Car has done 64,000 km = 39,000 miles.

But I felt compelled to warn other people if they are on the fence of leasing a Mercedes.  My lease return was up in December.  When I did the vehicle inspection, Mercedes hit me with a $1,700.00 bill.  I was allowed 36k miles, I actually returned the car with 24k miles on it.  Barely driven it.  They basically told me if I get into another Benz, they would waive the balance.  I didn't want to because I didn't know what my job situation was going to be in 3-6 months.  So I decided to not lease until that the job thing was more clear.  Mercedes knowing that I will not be leasing right away decided to tack on so many fees.  I called them up and asked if there is anything they can do, but there customer service was lousy and they were not willing to budget (unless I decided to lease another car from them).  No way I will ever lease a Mercedes if they were the last car company on earth.  Posting this to serve as a heads up to potential people thinking about it.  I've leased my cars in the past, and the Mercedes thing left a pretty awful taste in my mouth.  There thing is, unless we can sell you another car, we are going to try to make as much $$$ on you when you exit.

What does a slipping transmission mean in these E36s? I know some transmissions can recover with a fluid change+filter. Is that something that could work here, or just replace it?

"E87 Bluetooth/Music options? Hey all


Have just spent the last thirty minutes searching, if the question has been answered somewhere else please link.


I have a 2010 118d E87 and am trying to get bluetooth connectivity for audio - not just phone calls. To do this in the past with other vehicles I have managed to find a module on the internet that plugs into one of the inputs in the rear and a 12V feed. The stereo then just thinks it's a CD stacker or something, and when the car starts up it automatically connects to my phone for music, and fields phone calls as well with an integrated mic that you mount somewhere in the cabin.


Does anyone know of such a product for my car? I do have 3.5mm AUX input under the centre console, and some strange plug inside the centre console itself - I'm guessing this is for a phone of some sort. The stereo currently connects just fine via bluetooth to my phone for phonecalls only.

It’s time for a used but new to me Mercedes, I’ve got a budget of $12,000 and am looking for a reliable/luxurious modern Mercedes (2005 and newer) I’m not against any specific type of Mercedes, coupes, sedans, SUV’s but the newer the better.

A little sunroof help requested. W202 C220 Hello I have a confusing problem. the accordion piece of my sunroof on my driver side fell out and became jammed. It also came out with a piece of plastic that somewhat matches the track shape. The sunroof will not close still and appears to simply be jamming. I plan to put it back together once i can get it shut but what else could be back there that is jamming it? The sunroof is about 2 inches away from closing. Thank you very much for your time!

Friends were gifted an ‘83 300D turbo diesel. They need money and are selling it for $700. It’s got about 279k miles and is in decent shape overall. They have all the original booklets and even some service records from the original owner (who gave it to them.) it’ll need tires, battery, and I’ll probably do a diesel purge along with changing out some small stuff, detailing it, and hopefully replacing the first aid kit cover if I can find it.

"Issues with gear shifting after a service - 2016 A180. Hi! I had my car serviced a week ago. I had the B5 service and they ended up putting in new spark plugs as it was at the 60k mark on the odometer and due to be changed. Prior to the service, my car was actually running pretty damn good, there was nothing that stood out to me as needing attention. Got it serviced and now I feel like its actually running worse! I feel like it has no power (and please don't make any jokes about the fact that its an A180 Automatic 🙄) and is having issues with changing gears.


It doesn't seem to have the power to accelerate well and its almost like its having issues changing gears. From a standstill, it feels like its revving high and just not able to get out of the lower gears easily. And there's a few times where I'm going up a small hill and I'm unable to maintain the speed, I've got my foot hard on the pedal and the car just gets slower and slower going up the hill and just cant accelerate.


I am going to call my mechanic, but I wanted to ask for peoples opinions on what is happening and advice in regards to the mechanic. I dont want to call the mechanic and have to take it in and it cost me heaps of money. Considering my car was running fine BEFORE the service, I feel like this is something that the mechanic needs to fix at their cost.

"Looking at a 2007 ML350, concerned about reliability and costs Hi folks,

The car looks pretty clean, and if we like it we will definitely take it in to a reputable indie Euro mechanic for a PPI.  I'm concerned about maintenance and repair costs.  My dad has an 09 ML350 that he loves, and that has been perfectly reliable and cheap to run for the last 180K miles.  Aside from oil and tires, he's had to do almost nothing to it in the last 11 years.


However, I have read that the 07 model year has issues with the balance shaft and oil cooler--potentially, very very expensive issues to address.  I know that the balance shaft has not been replaced, and it's on its original timing chain.  Should I stay away?  I will have room left in the budget for repairs and maintenance but not the thousands of dollars it would cost to address those issues.

"9G-Tronic weird shifting (not shifting) So I picked up my second hand SLC 300 with an automatic transmission on couple days ago. I have been discovering it in the past few days, and today something weird happened. The car did not shift down from third gear as I started slowing down, and the car started jerking and stalling.


Preludes that lead up to this:
I was in Sport+ mode.
Very bumpy road section.
Slowing down with engine brake as I was approaching the red light.
Gave a tiny trickle of throttle for a second. (don't know why)
It was then that the automatic transmission continued on in third gear and did not shift down, as I lost speed. 


Theory 1: the bumpy road shifted something around in the transmission, since the SLC is a very stiff ride.
Theory 2: the tiny half a second throttle may have tricked the computer into thinking that I want to accelerate, thus it making it not shift down. If theory 2 is the case, then it still shouldn't happen. The second the engine starts to stall, the computer should recognize it and shift down immediately.


Anyone encounter the same problem? Should I worry about it, or does it just seem like a ""one in a million"" scenario?


PS: on a separate occasion, I tried out the normal sport mode, and it did not shift up from first gear. Had to manually shift up after seeing the rpm go to 4000. After putting it back into D, it shifted normally again.",0,1

"Driving 1987 300sdl without Turbo for a couple months? So, I am about to become a proud owner of my first Mercedes. It's a 1987 300sdl. The only problem with it is that the turbo isn't working. I work with mechanics at my job, so they checked it out and said they'd just have to ""clean the turbo out"" and give it sort of a tune up (some new little components costing next to nothing), and it'll work fine. The job will be 4-5 mechanic hours, so that's where I can't afford the work just yet.
So, my question is, will this car be ok to drive for two or three months until I can afford to get the turbo back into working order, or should I sit on it until I repair the turbo? Take into account that I'd only be driving it about 15 miles to work and back 3 days a week, and that it's a completely flat drive. Absolutely no hills. Also, the last owner drove it about 7 miles per day, for one month without turbo. But it only recently stopped working, so hopefully that means there hasn't been much strain on the engine.

"Mercedes-Benz CLS W219 320 CDI Hi guys. I'm from the UK and currently driving a BMW E90 318I. I am thinking of getting a Mercedes Benz CLS 320 CDI as the price is really good here in the UK. I have a few questions as I have not owned a Mercedes previously and would appreciate if someone can answer them for me.




Reliability. My BMW have not been the best reliability wise and I was wondering if a CLS is any better? I am looking at a 07 or 08 year model. Can anyone who owns one or previously owned on comment on the reliability?




Performance. 318 is slow, no question about it. But I'm wondering how fast would a CLS 320 CDI be? I saw the 0-60 time to be 7 seconds which honestly isn't that impressive for a 3 liter engine but can someone tell me how it actually feels like to drive? My friend owns the 05 plate CLS 500 and it feels blisteringly fast, does the 320 CDI comes anywhere near that level of performance?




Economy. The car on paper shows 25 ish mpg around town and 45 ish on the motorway. But what does the real world mpg figures look like?






That's all the questions for now and I will keep this post updated once I get the car in the few weeks times.

"84 318i or 96 318ti for rally? Hello r/BMW! I've found an old 84 318i along with a 96 318ti, both coupes for around the same price and I was wondering if you guys could weigh in on which would make a better rally machine? The 84 is obviously older and has the smaller m10 powerplant, but its lighter than the 96.

"'08 M6 Alternator Question Hey all - I brought my '08 M6 into my local dealer to diagnose a fault code, but they said the alternator needs to be replaced before they can do anything. I watched a few videos about replacing it and it seems fairly straightforward, but there's a good number of things that need to come out before you can reach it (and I'm not particularly mechanically-inclined). The dealer wants to charge me almost $2000 just to do that, which seems like a lot for a part that's available online for ~$200.


Am I in way over my head if I try to do it myself? Should I drop it off at a mechanic? I could probably also probably buy the alternator and then pay the mechanic for their time?

"2000 R170 SLK200K: ABS light Hi. My money pit of an SLK200 Kompressor now has a new ""feature"".  The battery drained to 0 volts (completely dead) after not driving the car for 2 weeks. The battery is less than a year old.  I jumped the battery (again), the car started fine but now the ABS Light is on.  I drove it around the block but was nervous about going any further so put it back in the garage.


Dumb question: Could the battery drain have somehow affected the ABS, i.e. is there any electrical connection that could be causing this, or is it really an ABS failure?  This is the first I've seen this message.  You have to pardon my ignorance in asking this but I'm (obviously) not experienced or knowledgeable in car repairs.


Also, re: the battery drain. I have checked that I didn't leave any lights on when I last parked it 2 weeks ago (btw the car was fine then), and there is nothing else running while it's not being driven. I've asked a couple of different mechanics to look into what's draining the battery and they just don't want to work on a car this old.

I am really unexperienced with Mercedes and dont know much about them or the different models. Overall i am not a car guy and probably most of the times if the car is attractive i will fall in love with it. 


• Some guy from the Mercedes subreddit told me to buy 
Cpo Sport W205
, but not sure if i can afford it based on the picture i saw on google.


What attractive Mercedes in my price range compares to the BMW's?


[Once again i am looking at second hand cars, not new]

How do you keep a nappa leather steering wheel from becoming shiny? I really like the matte finish on my nappa leather steering wheel. I’ve been in some older cars where the steering wheel became really shiny after years of use and would really like to keep that from happening for as long as possible. I know the usual method is to clean it using leather cleaners and then condition it but a lot of conditioners dont preserve the matte finish and leave it shinier than I would like.

"Any rumors or news about the next gen EQC II? I'm in the market for an EV, and I'm interested in the EQC. But it has some drawbacks, especially being a rebuilt and repuprosed petrol-engine car.


The rumor mill is completely silent on the next version of the car. Do you guys have anything to share?


EDIT:
Here's a list of the drawbacks I'm thinking of:




It’s basically a rebuilt petrol car repurposed to electric, not a true EV.





No frunk





Transmission tunnel causing less space for passengers in the back





Very shallow storage space under the floor of the trunk





Low ground-to-car height of only 16 or 19cm iirc





CarPlay and Android Auto is not full-screen on the wide-screen MBUX screen





No wireless Carplay or Android auto





Fairly short range compared to Tesla Model Y and Model X.

Can you hook up music with #2, #4 or #5?


If I did use one of these options for music how does the interface work for actually choosing the music?

"Mercedes Disappoints a loyal customer. This review is directed at Mercedes Benz as a whole. I am a Mercedes fanatic who is seriously disappointed. I currently own my fifth Mercedes vehicle. My son and I were hit in January 2014 and my ML63 had to be repaired. The airbags which are located in the seats were deployed and as a result the seat covers need to be replaced. The mechanic has finished all repairs and the insurance company has been covering the repairs. Mercedes however has not provided the replacement seat covers because they are out of stock. The car has been otherwise ready since February. I am going on 4 months now without my car because of Mercedes. Mercedes will not give me an estimate better than July. That would be seven months without the car. Mercedes says they will not provide a loaner or do anything else because it is not a warranty issue. This is unacceptable because the only reason I do not have my car back is because of Mercedes. Mercedes and every other car manufacturer, is required by law to provide replacement parts for 10 years.

"Looking to purchase a 2007 C280. Looking for tips/advice Looking at picking up a 2007 C280 as a ""second"" vehicle for winters and utilitarian reasons since it has 4 doors. It has just about 90k miles and ran and drove very nicely during my 10~ minute test drive. Whisper quiet, no vibration, smooth ride. Quite nice. Trans shifted smoothly, but on the slow side, but it's an automatic from the mid 2000's so I think that's a pass (let me know if I'm wrong here).


I'm trying to do my own research online and what I've found is that it's probably due for a timing chain soon, and that these M272 engines are prone to balance shaft issues. However, some are saying that the cars with this issue typically show before 75k~ miles or so, and this is beyond that. These are from posts from 2011-2013ish on popular MB forums though, so this information may or may not be still valid. I see balance shaft issues are a $4k+ ticket, but I can't find anything on timing chain replacement cost. I'm fairly handy (and my father is an absolute wizard) so we may be able to handle a timing chain on our own, but I'd rather not bother him with it if I can.


Oh, and the battery light came on about halfway through the test drive. It didn't die on me, so my google-fu says it might be a voltage regulator. I'll bring a voltmeter with me when I go to test drive it again.


Any tips/pointers? Run away? Looking to keep my initial purchase expense to under $7k, but obviously lower is better. I can probably buy the car for $4k-$4.5k. Leaves some wiggle room for initial repairs (or wear items).

"W210 2001 - EPC issue Hello everyone !


I have a 2001 W210 197hp and I’ve got an issue yesterday. I post here for help.


Since the beginning of the week, when I was at high speed, I felt the car has issue to accelerate and sometimes displayed “EPC visit workshop”. I had to look at this issue with my friends today (EGR valve or flowmeter). Unfortunately, yesterday when I left my work to go back home, I drove 3kms and car stopped accelerate. Same displays but nothing was working anymore. I stopped the car on the road edge and had to call a tow truck. 
Today the car is in the tow truck garage and Monday I will have to call my insurance. I’ll have to chose to repatriate the car to the closest Mercedes garage or à the garage I will chose in the same area...


What should I do ? I think I will have to pay high costs if I let the car to Mercedes ... 
If it’s the EGR valve or Flowmeter, it will be “easy” to fix. Do you think the problem can come from one of those parts ?

"1995 C180 Elegance (Auto) - help on buying appreciated! Hi all. I am in the market to buy my first ever car and needing advice from those far more knowledgable than I. I hope I am in the right spot.


I found what I believe is a gem of a car on carsales.com.au. It is (as the title says) a 1995 mercedes-benz C180 elegance for $2,990. I can afford this car, but if it turns out to be a bomb and need expensive maintenance, I need to give it a miss. Does this car have any known and obvious faults? It is 22 years old, does that make it more reliable (in that it has lasted this long) or less?


240,000kms, one lady driver, serviced every year with a full history, and never been in a crash. It has a roadworthy and 11 months rego (the owner is too old to drive and giving it up).


I am looking to drive it on weekends and on trips.


Please bless me with any knowledge you have on a) buying such an old car and b) old mercedes in particular and c) what questions to ask when I meet the seller. If I am in the wrong place I'd appreciate a heads up on the right place.


Thank you so much!! Alex",0,1
"‘18 230i Sound System Hi guys, I’ve been lurking here for a while and I’m now about to pull the trigger on a beautiful mineral grey, 2018 230i. Before I make the final call, I wanted to ask how the base sound system is. The problem is that it’s a few states away and I can’t check it myself.

"Tyre replacement on BMW 316i Hi Guys, 


So my second replacement is due (@ 120,000 kms) and I'm contemplating switching to regular tyres as compared to run flats. Thoughts / suggestions? 


I've explored a lot of forums but there seems to be a fair bit of conflicting sentiment on this. Apparently the regular tyres give one hell of a smooth ride as compared to run flats but there's the obvious trade off. 


If it helps, I drive a 2014 316i (Gulf specs - based in Uae).

"W220 issues with trunk release, soft close doors, central locking, etc. A couple of days ago I started having the following issues with my 2003 S430:

 - Doors cannot be locked/unlocked with either the key fob or the buttons on the dashboard


 - The rear headrests can't be lowered


These are the issues I'm aware of, there may be more. I removed and replaced the fuse related to all these functions (f62) and it didn't make a difference.

"2008 ML550 A/C blowing but not cold I just bought a 2008 ML550 - the first Mercedes I've owned since I had an old 300D nearly 30 years ago. A/C is blowing but not cold. I'm assuming it will require a new compressor kit, and I'm getting estimates from $1100 to $1500 for parts and labor. The $1500 estimate is from a Mercedes specialist, and the $1100 is a mobile mechanic that comes to your home, though he is highly recommended on neighborhood sites. I would appreciate any advice on the repair, especially as to whether the Mercedes specialist is worth the premium cost, or if a compressor kit replacement is standardized enough that it doesn't require the specialization and extra cost.",0,1

"Purchased GLK250. Check Engine light after 300 miles. Maintenance @ Carmax or MB Dealer? Hi all--I just recently entered the MB family with the purchase of a 2013 GLK250 one week ago, exactly. The car and I had a wonderful honeymoon (it was a big upgrade from my 2002 Volvo wagon), but last night, the check engine light came on, less than 300 miles after I left the Carmax lot. It's really stressing me out and I'm fearing the worst--that I got sold a lemon.


Carmax, as you probably know, offers a 30-day warranty. I also purchased the 100k extended warranty that allows me to use any MB dealer, in addition to Carmax (sort of like a PPO insurance plan). My question for the group is whether I should trust the Carmax dealer to adequately service the vehicle, or just bring it to a dealer near my office tomorrow? Odometer is about 41800--I do not know if it has had the 40k scheduled dealer maintenance yet.

"Having (starter?) issues with an '83 240D, wondering if anyone recognizes these issues. So a couple of days ago, I started having issues starting my car. I figured it was because it started getting cold and I haven't been able to plug the block heater in. It would crank really slow and then eventually turn over. And then it got to where it would crank really slow and then just slow down and die. So I started carrying a jump box with me, and about once every three times I started it, I would have to jump it. Now, I don't think this is a battery issue; I replaced my battery last year. Glow plugs have all been replaced in the past three years and fuel pumps too. Well, this morning I turn the key and nothing. No slow crank, no hum, not even the clicking sound it would make when the battery died. And obviously jumping it did no good. So with my limited knowledge of cars, I have concluded it's probably a dead starter. Does anyone have any insight?


On a slightly different note: I just moved to Raleigh, NC and this isn't the first issue I've had with my car since I moved. Last time she was giving me trouble, I couldn't find a diesel mechanic who would work on my car. So if anyone has any insight on that either, that would be great.",0,1

"Got a pre-purchase inspection today I took the '17 E400 Wagon I'm interested in for a pre-purchase inspection today at a MB shop. Overall  it looks decent for a 6 year old and 65k mile car. The items found that I have concerns about are:




Vibration at about 70mph. Kind of high frequency to be an off balance tire. It's enogh to be heard in certain circumstances. I'm having the dealer investigate further as this is the biggest question mark for me at the moment.


Both headlights top mounting tab is cracked (is this common?).


Oil seepage from timing covers (minor).


RF lower ball joint moderate play. 


Oil seepage at front differential pinion flange (minor).


Brake fluid leaking from loose RF caliper bleeder (!!! NOT happy about this one).




The tech said overall it looked pretty nice. He said the seepage at the timing covers and pinion cover were minor and not real cause for concern. Balljoing play is self explanitory. He wasn't able to comment on the high speed vibration since he wasn't able to get up to speed on his test drive. The shop is a ways away from freeways. Thankfully he was willing to tighten the caliper bleed screw (I know it's not his job to make repairs).

"Mercedes C320 2001 transmission is acting weird //DISCLAIMER// First of all, please note that I'm not sure if this place is the right one to ask my questions, I've just happened to find this sub & if it's not, feel free to delete my post. Also, I understand that asking Reddit for mechanical problems is not the best way to adress it but if someone had the same problems as me, we can all benefit from it.


So there it is, I've worked all summer long and I decided to go get myself a Mercedes ! I found a great Mercedes C320 2001 (W203) and I jumped on it. 3 weeks later, my car is in the mechanics shop for a transmission fluid leak. I've read a lot on Mercedes transmissions and I'm still not sure wheter this is a transmission fluid problem or a TCM problem. Here is a list of all the problems I had since I bought it:


- I was driving approx. 95mph and suddenly, the car stopped giving power, my wheels stopped moving for a fraction of a second and the car went in neutral. Got on the side of the road, turned off the car and powered it up, everything went back to normal.- Same thing happend maybe one week after.- I was at a red light, when it turned green the car didn't had any power, like if it was stuck in 3rd or 4th gear. Gave it a lot of power (because there was upcoming trafic on the other side), the car ''bounced'' a lot and got back to normal.


- When I start to move the car around in first gear, sometimes I hear some rumbling noise, I suspect it's only metal ratteling but, still.- In the morning, I've found that there was a big oil leak right below my car. I went straight to the mechanic and identified it as a transmission fluid leak.


Now, it's getting repaired as I'm writing this post but a thousand dollars later in repairs, I still hope the TCM is not done as well. What do you guys think ? Feel free to ask as many questions as you want.  


EDIT: I've done a OBDII scan, but the reader that I have couldn't get to the TCM. Code is P0700, but wouldn't get any further.",0,1
